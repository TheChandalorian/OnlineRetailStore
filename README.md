# OnlineRetailStore
Made a online retail fashion store, focusing on the diaply and layout
Took what i learnt in my class, self reserach and a few youtube videos to colaborate and bundle together the final project you see

Colour scheme was chosen for me, just something a bit brighter
Many more to come in the future, as i'm continuing to develop a working one, with further features, and linking mailchimp or other subscriptions news letter service, and being able to link a SWL data base to maintain users data (FOR TESTING and not actual use)
